# NoSleep Web App

A simple, web-based application designed to keep your machine awake — with a twist of fun.

## 🚀 Features

- **Prevents your device from sleeping** while the page is open and fullscreen.
- Works great on **Steam Deck (Desktop Mode)** to prevent sleep during long downloads.
- Doubles as a collection of **fun and animated screensavers**.
- Can be used as a **live desktop background** via [Lively Wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/).

## 🖥️ Use Case: Steam Deck

On the Steam Deck, if the system sleeps while downloading games or updates, the download stops.  
This app helps you avoid that by keeping the system awake — just open it in Desktop Mode and let it run.

## 🎨 Screensaver Modes

Pick from a variety of animated modes:

### 🕹️ Flying Steam Decks
An homage to the classic **Flying Toasters** screensaver — Steam Decks with wings soar across the screen.

### 📦 Bouncing Box
A configurable number of colorful boxes bounce endlessly, reminiscent of old screensavers.

### ➡️ Lines
A configurable number of colorful lines sweep across your screen.

### 💿 DVD Video
Multiple bouncing **DVD Video** logos that change color on bounce. A nostalgic throwback.

### 🔥 NFT Bros (Satire)
A satirical crypto/NFT screensaver:
- Watch NFT avatars fall from the sky.
- Some burn into smoke.
- Others get ground up by meme-inspired grinders.
- Quotes and reactions from stereotypical crypto bros appear as chaos unfolds.
